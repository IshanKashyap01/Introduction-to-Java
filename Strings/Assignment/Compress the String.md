# Compress the String

## Problem Statement

Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is
consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate
occurrences with the count of repetitions.

**Example**:

If a string has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".
The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.

**Note**:

Consecutive count of every character in the input string is less than or equal
to 9. You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care
of. Just implement the given function and return the compressed string.

## Detailed Explanation

## Input Format

The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and
trailing spaces.

## Output Format

The output contains the string after compression printed in single line

## Constraints

$0 <= N <= 10^6$

Where 'N' is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: $1 sec$

```ltf
Sample Input 1:
aaabbccdsa
Sample Output 1:
a3b2c2dsa

Explanation for Sample Output 1:
In the given string 'a' is repeated 3 times, 'b' is repeated 2 times, 'c' is
repeated 2 times and 'd', 's' and 'a' and occurring 1 time hence no compression
for last 3 characters.

Sample Input 2:
aaabbcddeeeee
Sample Output 2:
a3b2cd2e5

Explanation for Sample Output 2:
In the given string 'a' is repeated 3 times, 'b' is repeated 2 times, 'c' is
occurring single time, 'd' is repeating 2 times and 'e' is repeating 5times.
```

## Solution

```Java
public class Solution 
{
    public static String getCompressedString(String str) 
    {
        StringBuffer buff = new StringBuffer();
        buff.append(str.charAt(0));
        int num = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < str.length(); i++)
        {
            if(str.charAt(i) == buff.charAt(buff.length() - 1))
            {
                num++;
            }
            else
            {
                buff.append(num > 1 ? num : "");
                buff.append(str.charAt(i));
                num = 1;
            }
        }
        buff.append(num > 1 ? num : "");
        return buff.toString();
    }
}
```
